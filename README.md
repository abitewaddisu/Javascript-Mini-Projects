#### 6. Hidden Search

A hidden search bar, also known as a collapsible or toggleable search bar, is a user interface design element where the search input field or search bar is initially hidden from view and can be revealed when clicking on a search button icon with cool transition animation. The purpose of a hidden search bar is to provide a clean and uncluttered user interface by hiding the search functionality until it is needed. This approach allows users to access the search feature when they actively want to perform a search, while keeping it out of the way when they are engaged in other tasks.

#### 7. Blurry Loading

Blurry loading refers to a situation where images or content appear initially in a blurred or low-quality state during the loading process and gradually become clear as the loading completes. This effect is often observed in web pages or applications that prioritize faster loading times or have large media files to load. The purpose of blurry loading is to provide a better user experience by showing some form of visual content quickly while the high-resolution or detailed version is still being loaded. It gives the impression that the page or application is loading faster since users can see something rather than a blank or empty screen.
